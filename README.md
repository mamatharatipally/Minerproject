Resource Selection: Administrators identify and select educational resources that align with the 
platform's goals and the needs of the student community. These resources can include 
textbooks, lecture notes, Youtube links, and other study materials. 

Quality Assurance: Before uploading any resource, administrators ensure its quality and 
relevance. They may review the content, verify its accuracy, and assess its educational value to 
make sure it meets the platform's standards. 
Administrators will ensure that the resources they upload are legally accessible to users. They 
may obtain necessary permissions or use resources with open licenses. 

File Upload: Administrators upload the selected resources to the platform's database. They may 
organize resources into categories or subject areas to make them easily discoverable for users.

and identify areas for improvement. They also respond to user queries and provide assistance 
when users encounter issues with the resources.

Students play a pivotal role in a Student's E-Corner website by actively engaging in various 
activities such as registering, logging in, and downloading resources. Here's a breakdown of 
what students do: 

Sign Up: Students begin by registering on the platform. They provide essential 
information like their User name, password. For this we have created a signup 
form in which student’s fill the form and register. Which will be stored in the 
database called users.

by filling the login form. Once verification is done it takes the user to the student 
interface. 

Downloading Resources: Students get into their respective branch and access the 
subject, which they are required at the moment. Then they will download the 
respective resource. 

Admin interaction: Students can post their queries regarding resources. They 
can also give their valuable feedback to the websit
